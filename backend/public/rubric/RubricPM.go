var PMRubric = "problem-solving\nproblem-solving is a must for any pm. in fact, it's said to be one of the core pillars of google's (secret) interview rubric, called \"general cognitive ability.\"\nvery weak or missing: failed to ask questions, rushed into an answer.\nweak: serious errors or significant guidance needed in scoping the problem.\nneutral: scoped the problem, but missed key element(s).\nstrong: asked good questions and used answers effectively to scope a solvable problem.\nvery strong: asked insightful questions; set up an easy calculation and an accurate answer.\ncomfort with numbers\nyou'll often find pms in big tech often do quick calculations on the fly. this requires comfort using numbers to check assumptions and assess opportunities.\nvery weak or missing: failed to calculate on the fly or show competence with numerical relationships.\nweak: attempts to quantify answer were sloppy or needed lots of guidance.\nneutral: arrived at a fair answer with a nudge or two.\nstrong: calculations were accurate and quick, approximations were helpful and appropriate.\nvery strong: above-average \"ease\" in using numbers to an advantage; creative use of approximation, \"rules of thumb\", etc.\nability to identify possible errors\nit's very important when answering off-the-wall estimation questions that you pinpoint where you're wrong. this signals self-awareness -- that you'll be able to check yourself on-the-job.\nvery weak or missing: failed to discuss possible errors.\nweak: failed to reasonably justify decisions when pressed and/or made bad judgment calls.\nneutral: correctly identified some possible mistakes but missed others.\nstrong: correctly identified possible errors and suggested ways to increase accuracy with more information.\nvery strong: possible errors covered thoroughly, alternatives were offered, pros / cons were neatly summarized.\ncommunication\nall interviews assess communication skills to some degree.\nvery weak or missing: failed to communicate clearly despite repeated prompts.\nweak: poor communication throughout; interviewer had trouble following despite prompts.\nneutral: communication varied. clear in some areas but vague / incomplete in others.\nstrong: good communication skills; articulated thought process clearly and consistently.\nvery strong: clear, proactive communication; anticipated questions, articulated reasons for decision, \"checked-in\" throughout.\ncollaboration\nyou're expected to lead the discussion, but interviews are opportunities to collaborate, and this is encouraged! interviewers want to see how you'll work on a team, so don't forget to involve your interviewer in the discussion.\nvery weak or missing: failed to take the lead, didn't respond to guidance.\nweak: struggled to stay on track without guidance.\nneutral: took the lead and performed well, but may have needed redirects or hints.\nstrong: effectively led the discussion, involved the interviewer throughout.\nvery strong: took the lead and made exceptional use of the interviewer, discussion was more collaboration than interview.\ncreativity\nmost faang companies and startups look for creative and enthusiastic problem-solvers, and estimation questions are great opportunities to show off these qualities.\nvery weak or missing: failed to show enthusiasm or creative thinking.\nweak: solutions were bland, didn't show interest in the problem.\nneutral: showed reasonable insight, but nothing exceptional.\nstrong: thought processes logical, but creative.\nvery strong: exceptionally creativity and \"out of the box\" thinking on display; logic maintained, novel solutions found.\n"
